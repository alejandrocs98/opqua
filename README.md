[\[Chibcha/muysccubun\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chibcha_language)

      I.  *noun*. ailment, disease, illness

      II. *noun*. cause, reason \[*for which something occurs*\]


### Opqua is an epidemiological modeling framework for pathogen population genetics and evolution.

Opqua stochastically simulates pathogens with specific, evolving genotypes that
spread through populations of hosts that can have specific immune profiles.

Opqua is a useful tool to test out scenarios, explore hypotheses, and make
predictions about the relationship between pathogen evolution and epidemiology.

Among many things, Opqua can model
- host-host and vector-borne transmission,
- host recovery and death
- competition and evolution of pathogen strains across arbitrary adaptive
landscapes
- metapopulations with complex structure
- interventions altering demographic, ecological, or evolutionary parameters
- treatment and immunization of hosts or vectors
