## Example Plots

These are some of the plots Opqua is able to produce, but you can output the
raw simulation data yourself to make your own analyses and plots. These are all
taken from the examples in the `examples/tutorials` folderâ€”try them out
yourself! See the
[Requirements and Installation](#Requirements and Installation) and
[Usage](#Usage) sections for more details.

#### Population genetic composition plots for pathogens
An optimal pathogen genome arises and outcompetes all others through intra-host
competition. See `fitness_function_mutation_example.py` in the
`examples/tutorials/evolution` folder.

#### Host/vector compartment plots
A population with natural birth and death dynamics shows the effects of a
pathogen. "Dead" denotes deaths caused by pathogen infection. See
`vector-borne_birth-death_example.py` in the `examples/tutorials/vital_dynamics`
folder.

#### Plots of a host/vector compartment across different populations in a metapopulation
Pathogens spread through a network of interconnected populations of hosts. Lines
denote infected pathogens. See
`metapopulations_migration_example.py` in the
`examples/tutorials/metapopulations` folder.

#### Host/vector compartment plots
A population undergoes different interventions, including changes in
epidemiological parameters and vaccination. "Recovered" denotes immunized,
uninfected hosts.
See `intervention_examples.py` in the `examples/tutorials/interventions` folder.

#### Pathogen phylogenies
Phylogenies can be computed for pathogen genomes that emerge throughout the
simulation. See `fitness_function_mutation_example.py` in the
`examples/tutorials/evolution` folder.
